# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

## Spotify

And this is where specific API notes will go.

Try to include links and pictures wherever possible.


### Meetup.com API 
This API provides some great information about meetups and events. However, while some things are documented well there is a pretty solid portion that is not. There is not a list of query options you can add to your query, only the end points you can go too. The end points provide some good information but many of them you must know a lot of details about the event to make the query. Most of the data you will get will be fairly general as it is really hard to narrow searches without knowing the query parameters. If you are willing to tinker and find out what information you are looking for and filter it yourself. Then check out this API, it is not that bad. Tip use api v3, &radius= and &topic_catagory=   are your friends.
